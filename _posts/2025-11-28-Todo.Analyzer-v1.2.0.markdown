[Comment TODO Analyzer](https://github.com/sanelli/Todo.Analyzer) is a .NET analyzer for C#, it enforces coding standards to comments defining TODOs.

A new version (v1.2.0) of this .NET analyzer has been released today.

This version addresses the following:
- Upgrade projects to test aginsts .NET 10;
- Add suport to force a diagnostic error (`TA0002`) when any TODO is found when `todo_analyzer.always_report` is enabled;
- Add suport to force a diagnostic error (`TA0003`) for specific task ID listed in `todo_analyzer.report_tasks`.
