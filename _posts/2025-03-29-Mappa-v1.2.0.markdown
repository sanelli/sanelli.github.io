* [#53](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/53)Add support for `[MappaAssignFromConstant]` attribute;
* [#24](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/24) Add support for faster iterations for arrays and `List<T>` using `Span<T>` ,
* [#47](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/47) Add native mapping support between `Guid` and `byte[]`/`Span<byte>`/`ReadOnlySpan<byte>`/`Memory<byte>`/`ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`;
* [#164](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/164) Add support `params` and `in` keywords;
* [#167](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/167) Addressing leftover TODOs;
* [#107](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/107) Add tests to check mapping support for `System.ValueTuple<...>`;
* [#162](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/162) Released NuGet packages are built in release.

## üêû Bug fixes
* [#153](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/153) Mapping now take into account properties in base classes;
* [#159](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/159) When mapping from an interface the tree of implemented interfaces is taken into account when deriving the list of properties.

## üîú What's next for v1.3.0?
More feature are going to be added in future releases:
* [#53](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/53) Better detection of implemented interfaces in case multiple interfaces of the same type are implemented by the class;
* [#34](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/34) User should be able to select if they want to use the `Add` method or the indexer when mapping to dictionaries;
* [#54](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/54) When mapping from string support static `Parse` methods on the target type;
* [#70](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/70) Allow `MappaInvokeMethodAttribute` to support methods with `MappaMethodContext`;
* [#118](https://github.com/sanelli/Mappa/issues/110) When targeting read-only properties of type collection Mappa should support more types (e.g. `Stack<T>`, `Queue<T>`, ...);
